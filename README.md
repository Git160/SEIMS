**SEIMS**, shorted for **Spatially Explicit Integrated Modeling System**, is an integrated, parallized, distributed, and continuous **Wa**tershed modeling and **S**cenario **A**nalysis.

SEIMS is written by **C++** with support of OpenMP and MPI. **Python** is used for organizing the preprocessing and postprocessing workflow. The basic programming framework makes it possible for cross-platform, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS.

SEIMS contains several module classes, include **Hydrology, Erosion, Nutrient, Plant Growth, BMP Management**. Algorithms of watershed processes are adopted from SWAT, LISEM, WetSpa Extension, DHSVM, CASC2D, etc.

SEIMS is still under development and any constructive feedback will be welcome and appreciate.
